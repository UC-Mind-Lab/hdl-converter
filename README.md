# Why Docker?
Allows one to specify a specific OS with a specific build environment, that is cross-OS compatibile.

# How Did I Write This Docker File?
I based it off of [this ffmpeg in docker example](https://github.com/jrottenberg/ffmpeg)

# Where else can one get information about Docker
[The official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)

# Why a Make file?
Because commands are hard to remember. Running "make" and getting the terminal 
is much easier.

# What's the "delete_all_containers_and_images.sh"?
A dangerous script that deletes all images on the system. Use carefully.
